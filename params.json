It creates a virtual \"network tablet\"\r\non your PC that is controlled by your Android device.\r\n\r\nSo, you can use your Android tablet or smartphone to control the PC and,\r\nfor instance _use GIMP with your Android tablet as a graphics tablet_\r\n(even pressure-sensitive, if your hardware supports it).\r\n\r\nHomepage: https://rfc2822.github.io/GfxTablet/\r\n\r\nIf you want to support this project, please consider a [donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=ZT8F5NRCBDB2C&no_note=0&no_shipping=1&currency_code=EUR&item_name=GfxTablet+donation).\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nGfxTablet is licensed under The MIT License.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Ricki Hirner / powered by [bitfire web engineering](https://www.bitfire.at) / [gimpusers.com](http://www.gimpusers.com)\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Pressure sensitivity supported\r\n* Size of canvas will be detected and sent to the client\r\n* Option for ignoring events that are not triggered by a stylus pen:\r\n  so you can lay your hand on the tablet and draw with the pen.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* App: Any device with Android 4.0+ and touch screen\r\n* Driver: Linux with uinput kernel module (included in modern versions of Fedora, Ubuntu etc.)\r\n\r\nIf you use Xorg (you probably do):\r\n\r\n* Xorg-evdev module loaded and configured â€“ probably on by default, but if it doesn't work, you may\r\n  need to activate the module: see https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/issues/7#issuecomment-13338216\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nGithub repository: https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1: uinput driver\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nOn your PC, either download one of these binaries (don't forget to `chmod a+x` it):\r\n\r\n* [networktablet 64-bit, dynamically linked, tested with Fedora 18 and Ubuntu 12.10](https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/blob/binaries/networktablet-x86_64?raw=true)\r\n\r\nor compile it yourself (don't be afraid, it's only one file)\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository:\r\n   `git clone git://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet.git`\r\n2. Install gcc, make and linux kernel header includes (`kernel-headers` on Fedora)\r\n3. `cd driver-uinput; make`\r\n\r\nThen, run the binary. The driver runs in user-mode, so it doesn't need any special privileges.\r\nHowever, it needs access to `/dev/uinput`. If your distribution doesn't create a group for\r\nuinput access, you'll need to do it yourself or just run the driver as root:\r\n\r\n`sudo ./networktablet`\r\n\r\nThen you should see a status message saying the driver is ready. If you do `xinput list` in a separate\r\nterminal, should show a \"Network Tablet\" device.\r\n\r\nYou can start and stop (Ctrl+C) the Network Tablet at any time, but please be aware that applications\r\nwhich use the device may be confused by that and could crash.\r\n\r\n`networktablet` will display a status line for every touch/motion event it receives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: App\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou can either\r\n\r\n1. compile the app from the source code in the Git repository, or\r\n2. [download it from the open-source market F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdcategory=Multimedia&fdid=at.bitfire.gfxtablet) (**recommended**), or\r\n3. download it from Samsung Galaxy Apps, or\r\n4. [download it directly from Github](https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/releases), or\r\n5. [download it from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.gfxtablet)\r\n\r\nAfter installing, enter your host IP in the Settings / Host name and it should be ready.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3: Use it\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nNow you can use your tablet as an input device in every Linux application (including X.org\r\napplications). For instance, when networktablet is running, GIMP should have a \"Network Tablet\"\r\nentry in \"Edit / Input Devices\". Set its mode to \"Screen\" and it's ready to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nUsing with multiple monitors\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you're using multiple screens, you can assign the Network Tablet device to a specific screen\r\nonce it's running (thanks to @symbally and @Evi1M4chine, https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/issues/30#issuecomment-30605827):\r\n\r\n1. Use `xrandr` to identify which monitor you would like to have the stylus picked up on.\r\n2. Use xinput --list to identify the \"Network Tablet\"\r\n3. Do `xinput map-to-output \"$( xinput list --id-only \"Network Tablet\" )\" DVI-I-1` (here, `DVI-I-1`\r\n   is the assigned monitor).\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* With Gnome 3.16 (as shipped with Fedora 22), [Gnome Shell crashes when using GfxTablet](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1209008).\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFor bug reports, please use the [Github issues page](https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/issues)\r\nor just fork the repository, fix the bug and send a merge request.\r\n\r\n\r\nDonate\r\n------\r\n\r\nIf you find GfxTablet useful, please feel free to send a donation:\r\n\r\n**PayPal:** info@bitfire.at\r\n\r\n**BitCoin:** 1KSCy7RHztKuhW9fLLaUYqdwdC2iwbejZU\r\n\r\n**Wire transfer:**\r\n\r\n* Account name: bitfire web engineering\r\n* IBAN: AT81 1400 0272 1006 2055\r\n* BIC: BAWAATWW\r\n* Reference text: GfxTablet\r\n\r\n[![Flattr this repository](https://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=bitfire&url=https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet&title=GfxTablet&language=&tags=github&category=software)\r\n","google":"UA-3305033-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
