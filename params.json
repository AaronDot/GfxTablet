{"tagline":"Android app to control a virtual Network Tablet on Linux","body":"\r\nTo be informed about updates:\r\n\r\n* [follow GfxTablet on Twitter](http://twitter.com/GfxTablet)\r\n* [subscribe to our RSS/Atom feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GfxTablet)\r\n* [subscribe to email notifications](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=GfxTablet)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is GfxTablet?\r\n==================\r\n\r\nGfxTablet shall make it possible to use your Android device (especially\r\ntablets) like a graphics tablet.\r\n\r\nIt consists of two components:\r\n\r\n* the GfxTablet Android app\r\n* the input driver for your PC\r\n\r\nThe GfxTablet app sends motion and touch events via UDP to a specified host\r\non port 40118.\r\n\r\nThe input driver must be installed on your PC. It creates a virtual \"network tablet\"\r\non your PC that is controlled by your Android device.\r\n\r\nSo, you can use your Android tablet or smartphone to control the PC and,\r\nfor instance _use GIMP with your Android tablet as a graphics tablet_\r\n(even pressure-sensitive, if your hardware supports it).\r\n\r\nHomepage: http://rfc2822.github.com/GfxTablet/\r\n\r\nIf you want to support this project, please consider a [donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=ZT8F5NRCBDB2C&no_note=0&no_shipping=1&currency_code=EUR&item_name=GfxTablet+donation).\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nGfxTablet is licensed under The MIT License.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Richard Hirner\r\n\r\nPowered by [bitfire web engineering](http://www.bitfire.at) / [gimpusers.com](http://www.gimpusers.com)\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Pressure sensitivity supported\r\n* Size of canvas will be detected and sent to the client\r\n* Option for ignoring events that are not triggered by a stylus pen:\r\n  so you can lay your hand on the tablet and draw with the pen.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* App: Any device with Android 4.0+ and touch screen\r\n* Driver: Linux with uinput kernel module (included in modern versions of Fedora, Ubuntu etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nGithub repository: http://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1: uinput driver\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nOn your PC, either download one of these binaries (don't forget to `chmod a+x` it):\r\n\r\n* [uinput-networktablet 64-bit, dynamically linked, tested with Fedora 18 and Ubuntu 12.10](https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/blob/binaries/uinput-networktablet-x86_64?raw=true)\r\n\r\nor compile it yourself (don't be afraid, it's only one file)\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository:\r\n   `git clone git://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet.git`\r\n2. Install gcc, make and linux kernel header includes (`kernel-headers` on Fedora)\r\n3. `cd driver-uinput; make`\r\n\r\nThen, run the binary. The driver runs in user-mode, so it doesn't need any special privileges.\r\nHowever, it needs access to `/dev/uinput`. If your distribution doesn't create a group for\r\nuinput access, you'll need to do it yourself or just run the driver as root:\r\n\r\n`sudo ./networktablet`\r\n\r\nThen, `xinput list` should show a \"Network Tablet\" device.\r\n\r\nYou can start and stop (Ctrl+C) the Network Tablet at any time, but please be aware that applications\r\nwhich use the device may be confused by that and could crash.\r\n\r\n`networktablet` will display a dot for every touch/motion event it receives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: App\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou can either compile the app from the source code in the Git repository or download\r\nit directly from Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.gfxtablet\r\n\r\nAfter installing, enter your host IP in the Settings / Host name and it should be ready.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3: Use it\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nNow you can use your tablet as an input device in every Linux application (including X.org\r\napplications). For instance, when networktablet is running, GIMP should have a \"Network Tablet\"\r\nentry in \"Edit / Input Devices\". Set its mode to \"Screen\" and it's ready to use.\r\n\r\nIt's important that you start the app *after* the driver, because it sends the resolution\r\nto the driver. If you start the app before the driver, the mouse cursor will always be on\r\nthe left top and won't move much.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFor bug reports, please use the [Github issues page](https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/issues)\r\nor just fork the repository, fix the bug and send a merge request.\r\n","google":"UA-3305033-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
