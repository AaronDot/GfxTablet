It creates a virtual \"network tablet\"\r\non your PC that is controlled by your Android device.\r\n\r\nSo, you can use your Android tablet or smartphone to control the PC and,\r\nfor instance _use GIMP with your Android tablet as a graphics tablet_\r\n(even pressure-sensitive, if your hardware supports it).\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nGfxTablet is licensed under The MIT License.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Richard Hirner\r\n\r\nPowered by [bitfire web engineering](http://www.bitfire.at)\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Pressure sensitivity supported\r\n* Size of canvas will be detected and sent to the client\r\n* Option for ignoring events that are not triggered by a stylus pen:\r\n  so you can lay your hand on the tablet and draw with the pen.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* App: Any device with Android 4.0+ and touch screen\r\n* Driver: Linux with uinput kernel module (included in modern versions of Fedora, Ubuntu etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nGithub repository: http://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1: uinput driver\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nOn your PC, either download one of these binaries:\r\n\r\n* [uinput-networktablet 64-bit, dynamically linked, tested with Fedora 18 and Ubuntu 12.10](https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/blob/binaries/uinput-networktablet-x86_64?raw=true)\r\n\r\nor compile it yourself (don't be afraid, it's only one file)\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository:\r\n   `git clone git://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet.git`\r\n2. Install gcc, make and linux kernel header includes (`kernel-headers` on Fedora)\r\n3. `cd driver-uinput; make`\r\n\r\nThen, run the binary. The driver runs in user-mode, so it doesn't need any special privileges.\r\nHowever, it needs access to `/dev/uinput`. If your distribution doesn't create a group for\r\nuinput access, you'll need to do it yourself or just run the driver as root:\r\n\r\n`sudo ./networktablet`\r\n\r\nThen, `xinput list` should show a \"Network Tablet\" device.\r\n\r\nYou can start and stop (Ctrl+C) the Network Tablet at any time, but please be aware that applications\r\nwhich use the device may be confused by that and could crash.\r\n\r\n`networktablet` will display a dot for every touch/motion event it receives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: App\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou can either compile the app from the source code in the Git repository or download\r\nit directly from Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.gfxtablet\r\n\r\nAfter installing, enter your host IP in the Settings / Host name and it should be ready.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFor bug reports, please use the [https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/issues](Github issues page).\r\n\r\nIf you want to support this project, please consider a [donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=ZT8F5NRCBDB2C&no_note=0&no_shipping=1&currency_code=EUR).\r\n","name":"GfxTablet","google":"UA-3305033-11"}
